## Updates: 
- 4.07.2023: H2CO AYTY .def file was upated: the description of the QN columns was corrected
- 3.07.2023: SO2 line list MARVELised: calculated energies have been replaced with experimental ones plus uncertanties 
- 29.06.2023: Cross-sections app for NaH has been activated. 
- 21.06.2023: The format of the POKAZATEL H2O-16 was updated: the original energies were added, lables "-2" changed to "NaN", "m" and "e" to "Ma" and "Ca", respectively.
- 23.05.2023: The CaoH line list is available again. The .trans data for X-X transitions (Einstein A coefficients) have been recomputed and the cross sections have been regenerated. 
- 01.05.2023: The CaOH line list is temporally unavailable due to some issues with the Einstein coefficients of the X-X band. 
- 20.02.2023: 40Ca-16O__VBATHY.states file updated: two coulmns were added, a column with pure calculated energies and a column with labels Ca and Ma, indicating which calculated (Ca) energies were substituted by experimental ones (Ma).
- 24.01.2023: new D2H+ MiZo line list has been created. 
- 24.01.2023: new D3+ MiZo line list has been created. 
- 23.01.2023: H2D+ SP line list: states file has been updated with the MARVEL energies. 
- 23.01.2023: H3+ MiZATeP line list: States file has been marvelised. 
- 15.01.2023: SiN SiNFull line list: .trans files for minor isotopologues have been updated. These files had problems with many states IDs missing. 
- 05.01.2023: A new ZrO line list (B-X band) by Sorensen and Bernath, The Astrophysical Journal 923, 234 (2021).
- 05.01.2023: Atomic Opacities added for Na and K. 
- 01.01.2022: The MolLLIST line lists for 27Al37Cl and 27Al35Cl are renamed to MoLLIST-AlCl in order to break degeneracy with other MoLLIST line lists. 
- 01.01.2023: A new line list YNAT for AlCl is added for two isotopologues 27Al37Cl and 27Al35Cl 
- 16.11.2022: 31P-1H__LaTY line list: broken link was corrected. 
- 28.10.2022: 40Ca-1H__XAB.trans.bz2 updated: spurious transitions to an artificial D states are fuly removed. 
- 29.09.2022: .def files of H2S and SO2 are updated to make consistent with their .states files.
- 26.09.2022: Line lists for isotopologues of Si-N (SiNfull) are added. 
- 26.09.2022: A new LaO line list by Bernath, P. F., Dodangodage, R., Liévin, J., "S-type Stars: LaO Line List for the B2Σ+–X2Σ+Band System", The Astrophysical Journal 933, 99-105 (2022).
- 19.09.2022: H2S AYT2 line list: States file MARVELised 
- 18.09.2022: In C2H2 aCeTY States file, a column with Ca and Ma is added; the second set (duplicate) of the vibrational QNs is removed. The unc. and the 2nd Energy columns are reformatted. 
- 17.09.2022: A missing parition function file for HD (ADJSAAM) is added.
- 10.08.2022: 28Si-14N__SiNfull line list is added. 
- 05.08.2022: The 40Ca-16O-1H__OYT6 line list is added.
