## Updates: 
- 04.10.2023: The CH3Cl OYT TauRex opacity tables have been recomputed, which were reported to be corupted.

- 19.09.2023: a few MARVELised dupplicates from 1H2-18O__HotWat78.states and 1H2-17O__HotWat78.states were removed by re-MARVELising the corresponding energies.  
- 5.09.2023: 1H2__ARLR electronic line list for H2 is added, built from an H2 line list by Abgrall et al., Can. J. Phys., 72, (1994) 856-865.
- 5.09.2023: in 1H2-18O__HotWat78.states and 1H2-17O__HotWat78.states (MARVELised) the original calculated energies are added as the last column, see Polyansky (2017) for details. 
- 4.09.2023: HITRAN-HBr Line list is added for 1H-79Br and opacity tables for a natural abundance combination of two main isotopoligues.
